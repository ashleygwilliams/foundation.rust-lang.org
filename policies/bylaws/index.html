<p>(b) Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the Foundation’s records;</p>
<p>(c) Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership;</p>

No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.</p>

Any such proxy shall be valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with respect to all matters, if so desired) as may be stated in such proxy.</p>
<p>(i) The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the Board are held by active, contributing individuals.

Any Director who was appointed by a Platinum Member under Section 4.3(a) may be removed by that Platinum Member at any time, and for any reason, or for no reason. Any or all of the Directors who were elected by a class of Members voting as a class or by the Board may be removed by a majority vote of such class of Members or the Board, respectively.
