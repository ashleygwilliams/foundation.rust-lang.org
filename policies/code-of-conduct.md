The Rust Foundation (“Foundation”) has adopted the following code of conduct. Because the Foundation operates within the larger Rust community, this code of conduct is intended to align with the Rust Code of Conduct ([https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)). This code of conduct applies equally to all participants in Foundation activities, including board members, volunteers, and staff (except that, in some circumstances, the Foundation staff may be subject to a separate procedure as required by law). It applies in all Foundation spaces, including online collaboration tools, Foundation-sponsored events, and any other forums managed by the Foundation.

*   We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
*   Please avoid using overtly sexual language, including in aliases or other nicknames, that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
*   Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
*   Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
*   Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
*   We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups. Unacceptable behavior includes the following: 
    *   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
    *   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    *   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
    *   Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    *   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
    *   Inappropriate photography or recording.
    *   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
    *   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
    *   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
    *   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    *   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
*   Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us immediately at foundation-moderation@rust-lang.org. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
*   Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
